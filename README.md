The final code from a tutorial on how to make a basic website using HTML/CSS/Javascript, made for a [Georgia Tech BCM](https://www.gtbcm.com/) fundraiser.

I'm probably going to be embarrassed about this later, but that's most of my life (*in other words, we're on the right track*).

See the [final result](TODO: Add the url) here.
