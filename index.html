        <h2 id="meme-history">The Birth of Memes</h2>

        <p>In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth.</p>
        <p>Immediately afterwards, we came along and were given <i>one job</i>. Did we do it?</p>

        <img src="img/eve_fall_comic.jpg" alt="The Fall, as depicted by the internet">

        <p><b>No.</b> No we did not.</p>
        <p>Anyway, some time passed, God did more stuff among humanity, and humanity - to our utter surprise - <i>continued to be stupid</i>. So, God stepped on to the scene himself to pay for our sins and save everyone who trusts in him.</p>
        <p>This, however, only partially solved the whole stupidity thing. And thus, in humanity's wisdom that is below even the fooliest of God's foolishness, <b>memes were born</b>.</p>

        <p>God, in his mercy, has not yet punished us for this. He has, in fact, <a href="https://babylonbee.com/">even brought about good</a> from this evil. May we pray he continues to do so.</p>

        Reasons I shouldn't do this:
        <ul>
            <li>I could make people upset</li>
            <li>It might not be very funny</li>
            <li>In the event any of these people are actual superheroes, I have now revealed their secret identities</li>
